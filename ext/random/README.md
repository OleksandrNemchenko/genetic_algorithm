# RandomCL

RandomCL is an OpenCL library for generating random numbers in parallel. It contains implementations of more than 20 random number generators. While it is intended for usage on graphics processing units (GPUs), the generators can run on any OpenCL-enabled device.
The article [An OpenCL library for parallel random number generators](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11227-019-02756-2) contains further details about implementation and testing of the library.

# License

RandomCL is released under the BSD-3 license.

# Building 

RNGs do not need to be built - all code is contained in headers. Examples and buffer generation can be built using a makefile by running `make examples/examplePi/pi`, `make examples/examplePrint/print`, `make examples/examplePrintBuffer/printBuffe` or `make examples/examplePrintLocal/printLocal` and then running the created executable in the examples folder.

### Dependencies

- OpenCL library (examples and buffer generation require cpp OpenCL header).

# Documentation

There are two kinds of random number generators in RandomCL. Most generators are intended to have one instance of generator per thread. 
Their state is supposed to be saved in a private variable for each thread and threads can generate random numbers independantly. 
All of these have a similar interface. 

The xorshift1024 generator, however, has the state shared between 32 threads. Since state is saved in local memory it has a slightly different interface.

## OpenCL Interface

Each generator is contained in its own header named `<NAME>.cl`. It defines the following type and functions, where `<NAME>` is the name of the generator:

#### `<NAME>_state`

Internal state of the generator. Different definition (and size) for each generator.

#### `void <NAME>_seed(<NAME>_state* state, ulong seed)`

Seeds the RNG using given seed. Seed should be different for each instance of the generator (thread).

#### `uint <NAME>_uint(<NAME>_state state)`

Advances state of the generator and generates a 32-bit unsigned integer. State is not a pointer, since it is implemented as a macro for some generators.

#### `ulong <NAME>_ulong(<NAME>_state state)`

Advances state of the generator and generates a 64-bit unsigned integer (unsigned long). State is not a pointer, since it is implemented as a macro for some generators.

#### `float <NAME>_float(<NAME>_state state)`

Advances state of the generator and generates a 32-bit floating point number between 0 and 1. State is not a pointer, since it is implemented as a macro for some generators.

#### `double <NAME>_double(<NAME>_state state)`

Advances state of the generator and generates a 64-bit floating point number (double) between 0 and 1. State is not a pointer, since it is implemented as a macro for some generators.

#### `double <NAME>_double2(<NAME>_state state)`

Advances state of the generator and generates a 64-bit floating point number (double) between 0 and 1. For generators, that internaly generate 32-bit numbers this can be faster then
`<NAME>_double(<NAME>_state state)`, as it is generated from 32-bit random number, instead of 64. State is not a pointer, since it is implemented as a macro for some generators.

## Buffer Generation

### `cl::Buffer generateRandomBuffer(unsigned int num, std::string generatorName, cl::CommandQueue queue, size_t global, size_t local, std::string type = "float", unsigned long long seed = 0)`
Generates a buffer of random numbers (on a fast device using this and reading random numbers from global memory can be significantly
slower than generating numbers on-the-fly in kerner where they are used).

`num` how many numbers to generate

`generatorName` which RNG to use. Valid is any name of RNG implemented in RandomCL

`queue` OpenCL CommandQueue to use

`global` number of threads to use for generation

`local` number of threads in a work group

`type` type of numbers to generate. Valid options are: "float", "double", "uint", "ulong"

`seed` set seed for repeatable generation.
